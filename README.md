# pcarfac
plugin implementation for perceptual metering based on the CARFAC model


# Dependencies & Licenses
The project relies on several sources of software with varying licenses.
Please respect these licenses.

JUCE has one licensing model.

The plugin gui magic extension has another license.

The CARFAC model has a different license to those, and the Eigen library probably has another variation on licensing. 

I do not plan to sell or profit from this software, and the same kinds of license restrictions apply i.e. no warranty of guarantee. 

Please support the authors of the content I have used in the project by purchasing the appropriate licenses.
